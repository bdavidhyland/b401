## Working in the Dev Container

This repository includes a dev cotainer which can reduce the need for setup on your end. You can read more about developing in a docker container environment [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers).

The dev container will automatically ensure that your environment has the correct version of python (3.11.4) and will automatically run `poetry install` and start the poetry shell with `poetry shell` on creation so you should be able to just start coding!

When running `jupyter lab` you will need to manually copy the URL into your browser to ensure the token is included or you will receive a login screeen instead of the lab landing page.
